# To create a library of code, do the following steps:

# step 1: Create an INTERFACE to your library: libhello.h

# step 2: Create an IMPLEMENTATION of your library: libhello.c

# step 3: Create a LIBRARY OBJECT FILE (.o) that can be linked with programs that use your library
# step 3a: or create a SHARED OBJECT FILE (.so) from many .o files that can be dynamically linked with programs that use your library
# step 3b: or create an ARCHIVE FILE (.a) from many .o files that can be statically linked with programs that use your library

# step 4: USE the library in other C code: (a) #include "*.h" (b) link in the libary code into a.out file

# step 5: Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable for finding shared objects in non-standard locations at runtime
